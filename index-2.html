<p>Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in <code>Quality</code> as they approach their sell by date.</p>
<p>We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that
we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>All <code>items</code> have a <code>SellIn</code> value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the <code>items</code></li>
<li>All <code>items</code> have a <code>Quality</code> value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
<li>At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the sell by date has passed, <code>Quality</code> degrades twice as fast</li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never negative</li>
<li><strong>"Aged Brie"</strong> actually increases in <code>Quality</code> the older it gets</li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never more than <code>50</code></li>
<li><strong>"Sulfuras"</strong>, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in <code>Quality</code></li>
<li><strong>"Backstage passes"</strong>, like aged brie, increases in <code>Quality</code> as its <code>SellIn</code> value approaches;<ul>
<li><code>Quality</code> increases by <code>2</code> when there are <code>10</code> days or less and by <code>3</code> when there are <code>5</code> days or less but</li>
<li><code>Quality</code> drops to <code>0</code> after the concert</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Conjured"</strong> items degrade in <code>Quality</code> twice as fast as normal items</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to make any changes to the <code>UpdateQuality</code> method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly. However, do not alter the <code>Item</code> class or <code>Items</code> property as those belong to the
goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code
ownership (you can make the <code>UpdateQuality</code> method and <code>Items</code> property static if you like, we'll cover
for you).</p>
<p>Just for clarification, an item can never have its <code>Quality</code> increase above <code>50</code>, however <strong>"Sulfuras"</strong> is a
legendary item and as such its <code>Quality</code> is <code>80</code> and it never alters.</p>
